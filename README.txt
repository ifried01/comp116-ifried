 Comp 116 - Introduction to Computer Security

 This GitHub repository contains my semester's work from my introduction to Computer Security class.
 It showcases the different topics that we have covered, ranging from analyzing .pcap files, to completing
 a technical risk analysis on a capture the flag game, and to a final paper I wrote on security relating to
 Medical Applications and Implantable Medical Devices.

My favorite lab/assignment was the final project because it gave me the opportunity to delve into a field
I was interested in and look at it from a different perspective, namely from the persepctive of my new
knowledge in security.

I think that I have grown a lot from the beginning of the semester. I have become much more aware of the
considerations and challenges that are faced when implementing any security system. I have also learned
that no matter how securely a system is built, there is never a true 100% guarantee of perfect privacy.
The assignments and labs in this class have reinforced these lessons by providing me with the experience
to implement some of these "security breaking" methods.

The most important thing I have learned in this course is to never let my guard down when it comes to
information that could be used for a security exploitation. Any papers that I throw out or any forms
that I complete increase the potential of my private information reaching the wrong hands.

Now that I have finished this course, I am very interested in pursuing the security of medical applications
and implantable medical devices. I have interests of this field outside security, and believe that having
a more complete understanding of the field from more aspects will provide me with more opportunities
for success and development.
